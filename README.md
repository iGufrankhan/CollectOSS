## What is CollectOSS?
CollectOSS is a software suite for collecting structured data
about [free](https://www.fsf.org/about/) and [open-source](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) software (FOSS) communities via git forges.

CollectOSS's main focus is to measure the overall health and sustainability of open source projects, as these types of projects are system critical for nearly every software organization or company.

The data CollectOSS collects covers more than just code contributions and extends to anything that can be derived from forge data, including comments, change reviews, releases, and other project activity or interactions. This data is stored in a relational database (PostgreSQL), enabling large-scale data aggregation across any number of repositories to provide context about the way these communities evolve.

CollectOSS is part of [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community), which is a Linux Foundation® project. Many of our metrics are implementations of the [metrics](https://chaoss.community/kb-metrics-and-metrics-models/) defined by the CHAOSS community.

## Versions and support
CollectOSS is a Python project distributed via container images and aims to support all currently-supported versions of Python on macOS and Linux platforms. Docker is the primary supported container runtime, but Podman is also supported and used by some maintainers, although it requires configuring some extra permissions to run correctly.

Our `main` branch is our development branch that all pull requests should be based on. The `release` branch is where we merge and tag new versions and is the branch we recommend using in production. You can see tagged versions and corresponding release notes on the [releases page](https://github.com/chaoss/collectoss/releases).

## Installation
Basic initial setup can be completed in a few minutes as follows:

1. Clone the repository - `git clone https://github.com/chaoss/collectoss`
2. (optional) if you want to build the development version, run `docker compose build`
3. Copy the `environment.txt` file to a new file called `.env` and fill in values for the required variables
4. Run `docker compose up` to start the containers

Check out the [CollectOSS Documentation](https://collectoss.readthedocs.io) for more detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting steps.
