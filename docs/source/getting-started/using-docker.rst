Docker Compose
==============
For quickest start up, set up Docker or Podman desktop with a machine with roughly
the following resources (or more).

- 8 CPUs
- 100 GB disk
- 10 GB RAM

1. Clone the CollectOSS repository https://github.com/chaoss/collectoss


2. Create a ``.env`` file in the top level directory with the following fields (don't remove any variable, keep placeholder values if you don't need some of them):

.. code:: python

    COLLECTOSS_DB=augur
    COLLECTOSS_DB_USER=augur
    COLLECTOSS_DB_PASSWORD=password_here

    COLLECTOSS_GITHUB_API_KEY=ghp_value_here
    COLLECTOSS_GITHUB_USERNAME=gh_username
    COLLECTOSS_GITLAB_API_KEY=placeholder
    COLLECTOSS_GITLAB_USERNAME=placeholder

3. Build the container using one of the following commands:

.. code:: shell

    docker compose up --build

or

.. code:: shell

    podman compose up --build

And collectoss should be up and running! Over time, you may decide that you want to download and run newer releases of CollectOSS. It is critical that your ``.env`` file remains configured to use the same database name and password; though you can change the password if you understand how to connect to a database running inside a Docker container on your computer.

Rebuilding CollectOSS in Docker
-------------------------------

To rebuild a fresh CollectOSS database in Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Stop the running containers** (if any):

    .. code:: shell

        docker compose down

2. **Remove the existing database volumes and containers** to clear all data:

    .. code:: shell

        docker system prune -af
        docker volume prune -af

3. **Rebuild and start the containers**:

    .. code:: shell

        docker compose up --build
